<p align="center">
  <strong>Optimized Concurrent & Crash-Resilient Database Engine</strong>
</p>

OCERA is a small educational embedded database engine built in C++ to demonstrate Operating Systems and DBMS concepts: page-based storage, buffering, indexing, transactions, locking, deadlock detection, logging, and crash recovery.

## Current status (2026-10-10)

**Month 1 storage foundation is implemented and merged into `main`.** The current working storage layer includes a 4 KiB page type, disk I/O, a free-space bitmap, and a database header. The storage and header tests have passed in the reported clean build.

Not yet implemented: Buffer Pool/LRU, B+Tree, record/table and catalog layers, SQL parsing/execution, transaction and lock management, deadlock detection, WAL, checkpointing, and crash recovery. Treat these as planned work, not existing functionality.

## Team ownership

| Teammate | Primary ownership | Main delivery window |
|---|---|---|
| Dhruv Prakash — team lead | Storage engine, Buffer Pool Manager/LRU, integration coordination | Month 1 storage (done); Buffer Pool in Month 2; ongoing integration |
| Ishika Singh | B+Tree/indexing, table/catalog and SQL front-end; primary owner for WAL/recovery unless the team revises this | Month 2 for indexing/SQL foundation; Month 4 for WAL/recovery |
| Bhavya Goel | Transaction Manager, Lock Manager, 2PL, deadlock detection and concurrency tests | Month 3 |

**Ownership and schedule are different:** a month describes the planned delivery/integration window, not exclusive ownership of everything listed in that month. For example, Dhruv owns the Buffer Pool even though its delivery is in Month 2.

## Roadmap

| Window | Planned work |
|---|---|
| Month 1 — complete | Page-based storage, DiskManager, free-space bitmap/allocation, database header, storage/header tests |
| Month 2 | Buffer Pool + LRU (Dhruv); B+Tree, records/tables, Catalog and SQL front-end foundation (Ishika) |
| Month 3 | Transaction lifecycle, locking/2PL, deadlock detection/recovery, concurrency tests (Bhavya) |
| Month 4 | WAL, checkpointing, crash recovery, full integration, benchmarks, documentation and demo (Ishika primary for recovery; shared integration) |

The team may work in parallel. Each module must use the shared contracts in `docs/api-contracts.md`, and any cross-module contract change must be reviewed before implementation diverges.

## Build and test

Requirements: C++17, CMake 3.15+, and a working threads library. Docker/Dev Containers are the recommended common environment; see [ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md).

From the repository root in a Linux shell/container:

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
cmake --build .
./ocera
./test_storage
./test_header
```

On Windows native builds, follow the MSYS2 instructions in [ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md). The Dev Container setup has recently been slow/stuck on Dhruv's machine; that is an environment issue to troubleshoot separately from the database implementation.
